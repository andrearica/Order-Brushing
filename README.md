# OrderBrushing
Given Shopee's online shop data, I identify the users conducting order brushing on each shop. I was able to identify 89% order brushers in my code correctly.

The details of the problem are explained in each image file which shows a screenshot according to its file name, the data is taken from the csv file, and the code is run using any Python 3 notebook.

Algorithm/Though Process:
1. Separate each shop
2. Check every possible 1 hour interval
3. Check for order brushing
4. Store list of users who conducted order brushing on each shop in a separate data frame.
